1)Ctrl + i will align all the lines.

2)
to import git project, open git perspective and clone a git repository, it will import all the project files form the github.
we have to mention the url and username and password of github account.

once cloned to local repo, we have to import the folder into the project to work on it.

Right click on the folder in git and click import projects. 

after importing, right click on the project and select properties. Go to faucets and select java to convert it into java project.

Then go to build path and add external libs adn then build workspace.

Then we can do changes,commit and push to remote repository. Before pushing, we need to pull from remote so that the local repo is 
matching with the remote repo else it will not push.

3)
If you face any conflict files, try to reset the git to the previous commit and try to pull again.

Conflict happens when multiple users modify the same files and then we try to pull. To avoid this, better reset to previous commit
and pull again.
